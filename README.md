# London-Smart-meter-data-analysys-and-forecasting

The project aims to analyze the Energy Consumption Patterns and it's relationship 
with socio-demographic and weather indicators for European cities like London, post 
the installation of Smart Energy Meters over a period of 30 months. Exploratory Data 
Analysis was performed on Tableau and Python. Data Preprocessing was done using pandas 
and a variety of Machine Learning Algorithms were utilized to perform Time Series Forecasting.
